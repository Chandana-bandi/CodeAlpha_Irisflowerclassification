# CodeAlpha_Irisflowerclassification
Project Summary
This project builds a machine learning model to classify Iris flower species (Setosa, Versicolor, Virginica) using the Kaggle Iris dataset. The workflow includes data exploration, visualization, preprocessing, model training, evaluation, and saving the final classifier.

Dataset
Source: Kaggle (Iris.csv)

Features: Sepal length, sepal width, petal length, petal width

Target: Species (three classes)

Tools and Technologies
Python

Pandas, NumPy

Matplotlib, Seaborn

Scikit-learn

Joblib for saving the model

Methodology
Upload and load the dataset in Google Colab

Perform exploratory data analysis (pairplots, heatmaps, boxplots)

Encode target labels and prepare feature matrix

Train multiple models: Logistic Regression, KNN, SVM, Random Forest

Compare models using 5-fold cross-validation

Select and evaluate the best model

Save the trained model and label encoder

Outcome
A high-accuracy classification model capable of predicting the species of an Iris flower based on measurement inputs.
